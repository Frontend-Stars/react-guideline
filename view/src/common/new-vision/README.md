I am experimenting with overriding behavior base component, sometimes we want change any styles for base component easily and save logic of component in this version I want use css based change styles for base component without do more weight css selectors for overrides styles.

Goal: I want use, function for styled component or mixin if you use css, scss/sass or different driver for override css variables why I think is a better way? because we avoid manipulation css weight of selector, and we always know will be work this way
